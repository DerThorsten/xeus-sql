API
===

This API refers to the magics implemented to execute operations that are not SQL code. There's a distinction between ``xvega`` magics that implements magics from the ``xvega`` library and allows the user to create graphic visualizations of ``xeus-soci`` outputs and the ``xeus-soci`` magics that allows file operations.
